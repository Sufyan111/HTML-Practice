    <h1>Values of Industries to a Country</h1>
    <hr>
        <p>The industrial progress of a country is one way to assess its development. A country, that is not industrially
        advanced,cannot be considered strong. Although agriculture provides the basic necessities of life, the
        maximising of agricultural produce is possible only through sustained growth.
        </p>
        <hr><br> 
        <p>The modern equipments required for mass production in agriculture are to be manufactured in modernised
        industries.
        In India, the industrial sector contributes to more than half of our national income. The consumer items used in
        daily
        life such as soaps, toothpaste, medicines etc., are produced in large quantities, cater to a very large
        population and are
        manufactured in industries. this mass production is required to meet the demand and maintain prices with respect
        to the
        purchasing power of the people.
        </p>
        <hr><br>
        <p>India is a large exporter of various items such as textiles, food grains, medicines, etc., Therefore, our
            products must conform
            to international standards. Only superior quality and competitive prices can find a place in the
            international market.
        </p>
        <hr><br>
        <p>Industrialization alone can contribute to national security. There are no two opinions about this. Several
            ordinance factories are
            established to provide the security personnel with weapons. Regular updation of these industries is
            necessary to meet the growing need
            to improve the war equipment. or else it would lead to stagnation of technology. Today, Insia is responsible
            nuclear power.
            This was possible because of the constant industrial development since the time of Pandit Nehru.
        </p>
        <hr><br>
        <p>There is also a harmful side of Industrialization. These are related to pollution. Pollution of ground water,
            rivers, lakes, atmosphere
            and the sea. Add to it the growing population around the industrial belt. These problems must be addressed
            very urgently. Or else
            the progress achieved would be offset by national ill-health!
