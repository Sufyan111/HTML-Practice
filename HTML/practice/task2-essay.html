    <h3 style="color: darkslateblue;">Introduction</h3>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet in the solar system. It is positioned just next to Earth and thus scientists and
        astronomers believe that there could be a possibility of life on this planet just as our planet. The evidences
        about the presence of water and oxygen on Mars have raised hopes about the probability of life on Mars.</p><br>
    <h3 style="color: darkslateblue;">If I Get a Chance to Live on Mars</h3><br>
    <p>While the scientists keep sending spacecrafts and rovers on Mars to conduct their research, I often dream about
        going to the planet to understand if there are any people living there and whether life is actually possible on
        this planet or not.</p><br>
    <p>I wish I get some special powers to visit Mars and see how the planet really is. If I were on Mars, I would
        explore every bit of it to learn about it. I would live at different places on the planet to experience the
        variation in climate. I really wish I could transform Mars into a place which is fit for human civilization if
        it isnâ€™t already. I want this planet to stay as pure as our Earth was during the beginning of the times.</p><br>
    <p>If I ever got a chance to be on Mars and manage things there, I would grow several plants and make sure the
        people who eventually come to live on the planet lead a simple life like that of a villager devoid of the
        high-tech gadgets that are ruining our planet, Earth. I will ensure that there is no pollution on the planet and
        urge the people living there to contribute in keeping the atmosphere clean.</p><br>
    <h3 style="color: darkslateblue;">Conclusion</h3><br>
    <p>I want people to learn from the mistakes made on Earth and avoid the same on Mars. We have almost destroyed our
        beautiful Earth. I wish we do not do the same with the planet which is yet in its pure form.</p>
